    <h1>A tour of the dorm's hidden treasures</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to our guide of the different rooms of East Fairchild, where cherubs hang out, watch movies and work out.</h2>
    <h3>Game Room</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1FmqLM7UO8O8oSkMQJQZhFBFCIuXLrZkPc2Q6-wPgq8Y" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">Home of the first cherub-run ping-pong tournament, the game room also has an air hockey table and a pool table.</p>
	    <p>“I’ve really become an above-average ping-pong player,” Evan Kolin from Bloomfield Hills, MI, said. “If no one’s there you just hit the ball off the wall, instead of sleeping. No one’s there, you get the court to yourself and a lot of training time. Even if I’m not the most talented out there, I’m the most hard-working and that’s what I take pride in.”</p>
    <h3>Common Room</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1czGfpURKPSqDsvvDpOekHZc-z7v6vdx5ZVRAa3f3VSk" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">Cherubs stare each other down in the common rooms on each floor. With money on the line, none wants to lose a game of poker. Down the hall, another group smashes a ball into a Spikeball net. On other floors, cherubs gather to sing or hold conversations.</p>
	    <p>“I wrote a lot there,” Sam Zukin from Los Gatos, CA, said. “It’s more open. I don’t like being enclosed off in my room because being alone is sad. We had sometimes deeper conversations that got emotional with some people, but then we had really cool conversations about different TV shows, kidnappings and about anything.”</p>
    <h3>Study Room</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1XWVMdKLatO_RDNoGj6_P34q_KuSXRaXQzC7ZUUjwPK4" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">The study room is a great alternative to Norris University Center for getting work done.</p>
	    <p>“There’s a nice couch in there,” Ben Davis from Little Canada, MN, said. “It’s a comfortable couch. There are a lot of outlets in there. It’s pretty secluded, and it’s nice to be by yourself and get your work done.”</p>
    <h3>Movie Room</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1Lo9jM1qGUsKgLwwAqIGwyXX8Td8lCSBe5vtqo7k2Hio" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">The movie room has plush sofas and a big screen that covers the entire back wall.</p>
	    <p>“We watched the first episode of Friday Night Lights, one of the greatest television pilots of all time,” Aaron Park from Encino, CA, said. “It was a lot of fun. Fantastic episode. It was pretty intense.”</p>
    <h3>Main Lounge</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1rLvD2jjSEyMX2HHn-_nvyk7ZtH5dQxktNt1SotIFkvc" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">The main lounge is at the center of cherub life. Nightly check-in takes place here, as well as other activities like Lip Sync Battles and Cheraoke.</p>
	    <p>“After check-in I’ll stick around and play some group games like Mafia and card games,” Kavya Srikanth from Bellevue, Washington, said. “I like to play cards a lot, so a lot of my time is spent playing cards with other cherubs. It really gives us an opportunity to interact with other cherubs without the pressure of academics or working on a story together.”</p>
    <h3>Laundry Room</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1AMeMOcHF73tnCmP-IIdym4Hcfj4egQ_5fOE30Hzi0ac" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">Many cherubs face the daunting task of doing their own laundry for the first time while living in East Fairchild. The laundry room can get so busy that some cherubs stop a dryer mid-cycle to swap in their own laundry, leaving another cherub’s clothes still wet.</p>
	    <p>“I live in an apartment and it doesn’t have a washer and dryer,” Eunice Alpasan from Chicago, Illinois, said. “I had to ask for help many times. Honestly, I thought it was going to be such a big deal, but it was pretty easy. I just wanted to know whether I was doing it right.”</p>
    <h3>Gym</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1jOUDlG5lYGKSB5RPCaBTpZ8c7y2b7CTCB3VTbeJ0jhc" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">Hidden behind a door labeled “Publication”, the gym gives cherubs access to an exercise bike and a machine to build their upper body strength.</p>
      <p>“I do track back home and I wanted to keep in shape,” Danny Vesurai from Mountain View, CA, said. “If I’m frustrated with an article or a finished product, I need to take out my anger somewhere. To me, [working out] is like literally pushing through my problems.”</p>
    <h3>Dorm Room</h3>
      <div class="pano">
        <iframe src="http://scene.knightlab.com/scene.html?source=1eu_f9Wsfzi2G7sT3ZGJJ3thPFFI3Se7NiX8ui_C1YCA" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="spacing">This is a typical dorm room where cherubs spend their nights working or sleeping.</p>
	    <p>“It’s not incredibly spacious, but there’s definitely enough room for the stuff my roommate and I brought with us,” Sofie Jones from Belmont, MA, said. “We have definitely been able to make it our own. If it’s at night I’ll work in my room if the common room is really loud. I think there are other places on campus that are quieter and more conducive to getting work done, so my room tends to be my last resort.”</p>
